## 🚫 Common Mistakes

### Q: What's the biggest mistake applicants make?
**A:** Applying too early! Many people:
- Apply after 1 month of casual study
- Score 28/50 on CCAT (thinking it's "good enough")

Result: Rejected, must wait months to reapply.

**Better:** Wait until truly ready, then ace it first try.

### Q: What else do people get wrong?
**A:** Common pitfalls:
- Skipping CCAT preparation completely
- Only watching tutorials, not coding
- Memorizing solutions vs understanding patterns
- Not practicing with time limits
- Submitting incomplete/messy project
